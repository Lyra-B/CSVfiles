Files
=====

Let's practice working with files.

# Install

1. fork this repository using the fork button
2. git clone your own version into your projects folder
3. cd projects/files
4. ruby reader.rb data.csv

# TODO

We'll work on this together!

1. Add a class to represent an Order. Add attributes for po_number, agency_name,
nigp_description, po_total_amount, order_date

2. Add a class to represent a Supplier. Add attributes for name.

3. Add a class to represent an Address. Add attributes for full_address,
city and state

4. Think about the relationships between these models. Add accessors so that the
3 main classes Order, Supplier and Address are connected.

5. Add code to the reader class to populate the objects. Print out the total number
of Order objects read.

6. Add code to print out the total number of Suppliers. How can we avoid duplicates?
